    <h1>Your how-to guide for developing in a multi-platform world.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This site is a curated collection of agile, engineering, and product management best practices to get you started on the road to API-First development.</p>

    <p>In a multi-platform world, teams need to reorganize around API-First principals to <strong>efficiently</strong> and <strong>quickly</strong> create experiences and products which work across many devices.  We are here to help.</p>

    <h4>Problems that might sound familiar:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Traditional product design is device centric, but your company needs to be device agnostic.</li>
      <li>Device centric product design results in duplicated effort and wasted engineering work.</li>
      <li>We find that agile teams instinctively want to develop in an API-First way, but need ways to communicate across disciplines.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>We hate wasted work. We want to make the software development world a more efficient place... and it all starts with your API.</strong></p>
